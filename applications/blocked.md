## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Blocked is an engagement scoring protocol that empowers web3 builders to focus on valuable users and worthy actions via own scoring applications and allows them to reward the right kind of users for the most meaningful engagements.

### Overview

- **Name:** Blocked.
- **Brief Description:** Blocked is an engagement scoring protocol that empowers web3 builders to focus on valuable users and worthy actions via own scoring applications and allows them to reward the right kind of users for the most meaningful engagements.
- **Relationship to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama:** Having received a grant, Blocked will be able to integrate with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama protocol and enable web3 builders create own scoring applications and query relevant on-chain data from Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama protocol to engage users significantly better. 
- **Reason for Interest:** Blocked's team has extensive experience in web3 development, large network in web3 space, ans marketing reach of 300,000 active web3 users. We appreciate Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama for low transaction fees, dev-oriented approach and active community. We believe that together with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama protocol Blocked can radically improve the experience that web3 users are used to up until now. We aim to give users an opportunity to benefit from interacting with products within Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama network. We understand developers who are building on Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama and we strive to help them engage users effectively and with ease.

### Project Details

- Blocked is an omnichain engagement scoring protocol.
Blocked protocol allows web3 builders build a so-called scoring applications sApps which index relevant on-chain and off-chain data, scores it and grants users with scoring tokens. A user can exchange scoring tokens in case extraction conditions are met to any fungible or non-fungible tokens offered by our customer who has built corresponding sApp. We enable engagement scoring work in real time if desired by a developer. 

### Ecosystem Fit

- Blocked enables Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama power meaningful engagements inside its ecosystem. We do so via:
Educating new users on opportunities inside Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem;
Onboarding new users into the ecosystem;
Giving infrastructure to retain existing users through ongoing intensive programs.
- Our target audience degens and dApps and protocols. 
- There are no projects similar to blocked in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem.
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
- Blocked helps to solve 3 problems:
1) Projects attract the wrong users. Blocked helps to incentivize activity that matters.
Blocked builders can reward users for any actions that truly bring value to their product's sustainable growth.
2) Web3 solutions value wrong things. Our scoring protocol helps to detect what and who brings the most value.
3) Protocols and dApps incentivize wrong activities. Blocked encourage actions that bring the most value.
